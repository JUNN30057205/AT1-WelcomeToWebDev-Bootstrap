  <p>Q1: What are programming controls and design structures?</p>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#demo1">Answer 1</button>
  <div id="demo1" class="collapse">
    Programming controls is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, 
	and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of
	selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for) block structures, and subroutines. 
	Design structures is called structured design and can be described with four logical structures.
	When using the structures in a disciplined manner, the algorithm described in the pseudo-code is called a structured algorithm.

  <p>Q2: What are website testing procedures? </p>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#demo2">Answer 2</button>
  <div id="demo2" class="collapse">
    The website testing procedures consists of multiple steps that ensure that an application is fully functional and runs smoothly and securely. 
	It is an essential part of web development and ensure that an application is running properly before its release. <br>
		There are 6 steps as follows:<br>
			Step 1: Functional Testing<br>
			Step 2: Usability Testing<br>
			Step 3: Interface Testing<br>
			Step 4: Compatibility Testing<br> 
			Step 5: Performance Testing<br>
			Step 6: Security Testing<br>

  <p>Q3: What are website debugging methods?</p>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#demo3">Answer 3</button>
  <div id="demo3" class="collapse">
    Debugging is a methodical process of finding and reducing the number of bugs, or defects, in a computer program. A lot of web development tools are integrated into browsers. 
	These tools are not just for web development, but also serve a lot of other functions, of which debugging is one of the most prominent.  
	These tools help inspecting and analysing possible issues with the CSS, HTML, and Java Script used in the code.

  <p>Q4: What are website coding techniques? </p>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#demo4">Answer 4</button>
  <div id="demo4" class="collapse">
    HTML to create the structured web pages. HTML markup and sematic HTML elements to write a HTML document and understand the context of content. 
	Create Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to apply styles, layouts, and visuals to your web pages. It needs to understand CSS rules to write a CSS documentation. Adding the <link> tag and “rel” and “href” attribute to utilise CSS into HTML. 
	Understand JavaScript to add interactivity to your web pages. JavaScript is the foundation language for web development combined with HTML and CSS. It needs to understand a proper naming conventions, consistent indentation and comment the code properly.
